The init command is used to initialize a new JSX Mail project. It is used to create all the necessary files and folders to start using JSX Mail.

This command is very simple but to you use it you need to have a Node.js started project. So your current working directory needs to have a `package.json` file.

To initialize a new JSX Mail project, you can run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash yarn
yarn jsxm init
```

```bash npm
npx jsxm init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm jsxm init
```

```bash bun
bun jsxm init
```

</CodeGroup>

After running the command, you will see a lot of files and folders that was created. You can explore all the files. If you can't understand this thinks you should learn more about [JSX Mail Framework](/framework/learning/getting-started).
